the vigenere cipher, was invented by a frenchman, blaise de vigenere in the 16th century. it is a polyalphabetic cipher because it uses two or more cipher alphabets to encrypt the data. in other words, the letters in the vigenere cipher are shifted by different amounts, normally done using a word or phrase as the encryption key . unlike the monoalphabetic ciphers, polyalphabetic ciphers are not susceptible to frequency analysis, as more than one letter in the plaintext can be represented by a single letter in the encryption. the key is the flag.
